# Nei

hello there |･ω･｀)

this repository is storing my graduation project

it's just too young to be used so far

but i hope it can be helpful somehow

# Description

it's a preliminary React UI library.

[ant-design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) is referenced

create-react-app is NOT used. it's a absolutely great tool, but i want to config the project on my own this time (and learn how to config by the way)

# Todo List

huge quantity of things to be done and the followings will be synchronized

- [ ] write more UI components
- [ ] optimize packaging (how about using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb)?)
- [ ] optimize the webpack configuration
- [ ] build a homepage
- [ ] complete my graduation design document
